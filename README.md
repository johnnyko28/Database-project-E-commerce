# Database_project
The final project of CS340 Introduction to Database from Oregon State University Computer Science course. I designed a database representing an online shopping/e-commerce system. The reason why I chose this topic is because of my business education background and work experience in business. I am always trying to do something entrepreneurial and I believe this project is a good start for me to combine the knowledge of business and computer science. This project contains many aspects, from clients to products, also some details about the shopping carts and manufacturers.
