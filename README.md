# Database_project
The final project of CS340 Introduction to Database from Oregon State University Computer Science course. I designed a database representing an online shopping/e-commerce system. I chose this topic is because of my business education background and work experience in business. I am always trying to do something entrepreneurial and I think this project is a good start to combine the knowledge of business and computer science. This project contains many aspects, from clients to products, also some details about the shopping carts and manufacturers.
